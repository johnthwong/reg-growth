Project data is available to download upon request.

Please update data_directory (Line 14, "code.R") before running the R script or rendering the Quarto file.

R is required to run the code and RStudio is required to open the Quarto file. Additional dependencies are noted in Lines 5 to 9 of "code.R".

The docx file is a snapshot of the document exported from the Quarto file; the timestamp of the export is in the name (yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm). Changes to the write-up *can* be made through the docx file, though editing the Quarto file directly is recommended.
